	a.  Set the HOSTID to the ASSETID#
	b.  Set the INT to the Interface Name to capture off of.
	c.  Set the CAPDUR to the number of seconds the Capture to run for when launched.
	d.  Set the CAPFILESIZE to the file size in KB.

	f.  Set the DUMPDIR to match where you installed the BHCOL directories.
